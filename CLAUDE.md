# FreeFrame Media Platform — Claude Code Guide

Self-hostable, open-source alternative to Frame.io for production houses. Collaborative media review, annotation, and approval platform supporting images, audio, and video (up to 10GB) with org→team→project hierarchy, role-based permissions, versioning, canvas annotations, and public link sharing.

## Architecture

### Hierarchy

```
Organization
└── Teams (optional grouping of members)
    └── Projects (personal or team-scoped)
        └── Assets (image, image_carousel, audio, video)
            └── AssetVersions
                └── MediaFiles
                    └── Comments / Annotations / Approvals
```

### Permission Model

Permissions are layered. Each level inherits downward:

```
Org:     owner → admin → member
Team:    lead → member
Project: owner → editor → reviewer → viewer
Share:   approve → comment → view  (per share link or AssetShare)
```

**Asset access check order:**
1. Asset creator
2. Project member (any role)
3. Directly shared via `AssetShare`
4. Shared with user's team via `AssetShare`
5. Org admin

Guest users (`GuestUser`) can comment via public share links using email + name only — no account or login required. Stored in a separate table; no mapping to real users.

### Asset Types

| Type            | Processing                        | Outputs                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `video`         | FFmpeg → multi-bitrate HLS        | HLS segments (1080p/720p/360p), thumbnail, waveform |
| `audio`         | Normalize → MP3                   | MP3, waveform JSON                          |
| `image`         | Convert → WebP                    | WebP, thumbnail                             |
| `image_carousel`| Convert each → WebP               | WebP + thumbnail per image, sequence order  |

- Max file size: **10GB**
- Upload chunk size: **10MB** (resumable via S3 multipart)
- All entities use **soft delete** (`deleted_at` column — never hard-delete in application code)

---

### SSE Events

Single endpoint per project: `GET /events/{project_id}`

```
transcode_progress  → {asset_id, percent}
transcode_complete  → {asset_id, version_id}
transcode_failed    → {asset_id, error}
new_comment         → {asset_id, comment_id, author}
comment_resolved    → {comment_id}
approval_updated    → {asset_id, user_id, status}
```

No WebSockets — SSE only. Clients reconnect automatically on disconnect.

---

## Media Processing Pipeline

### Video (FFmpeg → HLS)
1. Download raw file from S3 → `/tmp/{version_id}/input`
2. `ffprobe` → extract metadata (duration, fps, width, height)
3. FFmpeg multi-bitrate HLS: 1080p (CRF 20), 720p (CRF 22), 360p (CRF 26), 2-second segments, forced keyframes every 2s
4. Generate thumbnails (1 per 10s)
5. Generate waveform JSON
6. Upload all to S3 `hls/{project_id}/{version_id}/`
7. Update status → `ready`, push SSE `transcode_complete`

### Audio (Normalize → MP3)
- Input: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, etc.
- Output: Normalized MP3 + waveform JSON
- No HLS — direct streaming

### Image (Convert → WebP)
- Input: JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, etc.
- Output: Optimized WebP + thumbnail
- Carousel: process each image independently, store sequence order

### Watermark Burning
- Dynamic watermark: burn user email/name into frames at share time (not stored)
- Position: center / corner (all 4) / tiled
- Opacity: configurable (default 30%)
- Video: FFmpeg drawtext filter; Images: ImageMagick

### S3 Content-Type Headers

```python
".m3u8": ContentType="application/vnd.apple.mpegurl", CacheControl="no-cache"
".ts":   ContentType="video/mp2t",                    CacheControl="max-age=31536000"
".jpg":  ContentType="image/jpeg",                    CacheControl="max-age=86400"
".webp": ContentType="image/webp",                    CacheControl="max-age=86400"
".mp3":  ContentType="audio/mpeg",                    CacheControl="max-age=86400"
".json": ContentType="application/json",              CacheControl="max-age=86400"
```

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Max file size | 10GB | Supports 4K raw footage |
| Chunk size | 10MB | Balance between request count and resume granularity |
| Video output | HLS (2s segments) | Frame-accurate seeking |
| Audio output | MP3 + waveform JSON | Universal playback + visualization |
| Image output | WebP + thumbnail | Optimized size, broad browser support |
| Annotations | Fabric.js JSON per comment | Lightweight, no extra service |
| Soft delete | `deleted_at` on all entities | Recoverable, audit trail |
| Guest users | Separate `GuestUser` table | No conflict with real user accounts |
| Real-time | SSE (no WebSockets) | Sufficient for async review workflow |
| Transcoder | Pluggable (FFmpeg default) | Works self-hosted; swap to MediaConvert in cloud |
| Auth | JWT (15min) + refresh tokens (7d) | Stateless; compatible with share link guests |
| Storage | MinIO (dev) / S3 (prod) | Identical S3 API; user controls infrastructure |

## Implementation Order (v1 Backend)

1. Project scaffold (Turborepo, FastAPI, Docker Compose)
2. Database models + Alembic migrations + seed script
3. Auth & user management (JWT, invite, deactivate)
4. Org, team, project APIs
5. Permission service + middleware
6. Upload & S3 service (multipart, presign, resume)
7. Media processing (video → HLS, audio → MP3, image → WebP, Celery tasks)
8. Asset & version APIs + stream URLs + asset discovery
9. Comments & annotations (threading, timecode range, guest comments, mentions)
10. Approvals & sharing (share links, direct user/team sharing)
11. Metadata & collections (custom fields, smart collections, collection sharing)
12. Comment enhancements (attachments, emoji reactions, deep links)
13. Branding & watermarks (project branding, dynamic watermark burning)
14. Assignments & notifications (due dates, notification API, due-date reminders)
15. Soft delete middleware + activity logging + cascade delete
16. Tests (pytest) + OpenAPI docs + README

---

## v1 Out of Scope

- Frontend (Next.js) — separate phase after backend complete
- Mobile apps
- Real-time collaboration (cursor sync)
- AI features (transcription, scene detection)
- SSO / SAML
- Billing / subscriptions
- NLE plugins (Premiere, Final Cut, Resolve)
- Camera to Cloud (C2C) integration
